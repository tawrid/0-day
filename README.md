# Daily Vulnerability Report 🛡️

This repository hosts a daily, automated vulnerability report. A GitHub Actions workflow runs a Python script every day at 18:00 UTC to fetch the latest 0-day vulnerabilities from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and publishes them as a clean, navigable GitHub Page.

The goal is to provide a simple, self-updating site that keeps a historical record of recent vulnerabilities, allowing for easy browsing by date.

## Features

* **Daily Automation:** The report is automatically generated every day using a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow.

* **0-Day Vulnerability Tracking:** Fetches up-to-date vulnerability data from the NVD API.

* **Historical Archive:** All daily reports are saved and organized by year, month, and day, creating a browsable archive.

* **GitHub Pages:** The generated reports are automatically synced and published to a user-friendly website.

* **Simple Navigation:** The website includes a dynamic sidebar that allows for easy navigation through the historical reports.

## How It Works

1. **Scheduled Trigger:** A GitHub Actions workflow is scheduled to run daily at `18:00 UTC`.

2. **API Call:** The `vulnerability_reporter.py` script makes an API request to the NVD to find all Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) published in the last 24 hours.

3. **HTML Generation:** The script dynamically generates an HTML file for the daily report, including basic styling and a simple layout. It then injects a navigation sidebar with links to all existing reports.

4. **Commit & Push:** The workflow commits the newly generated HTML files to the repository. The GitHub Actions bot handles the commit and push, ensuring the repository stays synchronized.

5. **GitHub Pages:** With each new commit, GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys the site, making the new daily report available online.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A GitHub account.

* A new or existing GitHub repository to host the project.

### Setup

1. **Fork this repository** (or create a new one).

2. **Add the Python Script:** Create a file named `vulnerability_reporter.py` in the root of your repository and paste the Python code into it.

3. **Add the GitHub Workflow:** Create the necessary directory structure `.github/workflows/` and add the `daily-job.yml` file. Paste the workflow code into this file.

4. **Enable GitHub Pages:** Go to your repository's **Settings** -> **Pages**. Select `Deploy from a branch` and choose the `main` branch. The site will be published from the root directory (`/`).

The workflow will run automatically at the scheduled time. You can also trigger a manual run at any time from the **Actions** tab of your repository.
