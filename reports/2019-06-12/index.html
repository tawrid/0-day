            <h3><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1064" target="_blank">CVE-2019-1064</a></h3>
            <p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows AppX Deployment Service (AppXSVC) improperly handles hard links. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run processes in an elevated context. An attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows AppX Deployment Service handles hard links.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1069" target="_blank">CVE-2019-1069</a></h3>
            <p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way the Task Scheduler Service validates certain file operations. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain elevated privileges on a victim system.
To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would require unprivileged code execution on a victim system.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correctly validating file operations.</p>
