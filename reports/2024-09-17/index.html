            <h3><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38812" target="_blank">CVE-2024-38812</a></h3>
            <p>The vCenter Server contains a heap-overflow vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network packet potentially leading to remote code execution.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38813" target="_blank">CVE-2024-38813</a></h3>
            <p>The vCenter Server contains a privilege escalation vulnerability. A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may trigger this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root by sending a specially crafted network packet.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8956" target="_blank">CVE-2024-8956</a></h3>
            <p>PTZOptics PT30X-SDI/NDI-xx before firmware 6.3.40 is vulnerable to an insufficient authentication issue. The camera does not properly enforce authentication to /cgi-bin/param.cgi when requests are sent without an HTTP Authorization header. The result is a remote and unauthenticated attacker can leak sensitive data such as usernames, password hashes, and configurations details. Additionally, the attacker can update individual configuration values or overwrite the whole file.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8957" target="_blank">CVE-2024-8957</a></h3>
            <p>PTZOptics PT30X-SDI/NDI-xx before firmware 6.3.40 is vulnerable to an OS command injection issue. The camera does not sufficiently validate the ntp_addr configuration value which may lead to arbitrary command execution when ntp_client is started. When chained with CVE-2024-8956, a remote and unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on affected devices.</p>
