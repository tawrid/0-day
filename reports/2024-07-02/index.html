            <h3><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39891" target="_blank">CVE-2024-39891</a></h3>
            <p>In the Twilio Authy API, accessed by Authy Android before 25.1.0 and Authy iOS before 26.1.0, an unauthenticated endpoint provided access to certain phone-number data, as exploited in the wild in June 2024. Specifically, the endpoint accepted a stream of requests containing phone numbers, and responded with information about whether each phone number was registered with Authy. (Authy accounts were not compromised, however.)</p>
