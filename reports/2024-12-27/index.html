            <p>A Denial of Service vulnerability in the DNS Security feature of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a malicious packet through the data plane of the firewall that reboots the firewall. Repeated attempts to trigger this condition will cause the firewall to enter maintenance mode.</p>

            <p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential out-of-bound accesses for Extigy and Mbox devices

A bogus device can provide a bNumConfigurations value that exceeds the
initial value used in usb_get_configuration for allocating dev->config.

This can lead to out-of-bounds accesses later, e.g. in
usb_destroy_configuration.</p>
